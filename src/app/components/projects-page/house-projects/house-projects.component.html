        <h4>The House</h4>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
            We like to say that the house was built 40 years ago and not touched since.
            The linoleum had an engrained foot path, the bathrooms were ravaged with wear and stains from our iron
            rich well water,
            and the kitchen cabinets were raw plywood. The exterior was weathered and in dire need of paint. The
            inspection failed on
            nearly all aspects. "We'll take it" we said.

            The first step on the kitchen project was a complete tearout down to the studs and down to the base
            floor. We took out a wall
            and framed up new beams for support. We re-framed the window openings to accommodate new and wider
            windows. The electrical,
            which is one of the inspection fails, all needed to be rewired. It was a situation where fixing what was
            there was not
            an option - it all had to come out.
            <br> Tearing out the floors was one of the more difficult tasks because the flooring under the linoleum
            was particle board
            nailed every two inches. Every pry with the crow bar was rewarded with about a four inch square chunk
            coming out.
            But what was underneath was a true 1 inch tongue and groove sub-floor that would be perfect for the new
            hardwoods we
            were planning to put in.<br>

                Once the flooring in the kitchen was removed, we realized we had to keep going into the dining and living rooms. So more crow barring
                to pull up the sub-floors. I learned that by cutting 1 foot squares into the subfloor with a skillsaw allowed for much easier removal.
