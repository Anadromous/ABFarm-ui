                Immediately we set to work on improving the house, like buying appliances that were literally missing, roofing the barn, and building a fence to keep in our future critters!  
                We also, with the help of our generous neighbor, tilled a giant garden!

                <div class="collapse" id="moreInfo">Fast forward two years, plus the pandemic which kept us home and working on the farm, we now have three Nubian goats, Elsie, Barb, and Bruce, (they keep the blackberries at bay), 
                    a llama, Tina, (she guards our sheep), and nine Suffolk/Hampshire cross sheep, (they provide us delicious meat).
                    
                    We have successfully raised three sets of lambs by just allowing them to graze on our pasture grass and then supplement with alfalfa and hay from Eastern Oregon during the winter months.  
                    The meat is sweet, tender, and lean!
                    
                    We have been working with the Tualatin Valley Water District on improving the farm for responsible water use.  
                    With help from a grant, we have installed many, many feet of temporary fencing so we can rotational graze our sheep, installed gutters along the barn to keep the mud to a minimum, 
                    and are in the process of building compost bins to recycle the sheep manure for use in our garden. 
                    This has been a positive and worthwhile partnership!
                    
                    We welcome any visitors to our farm, we are proud to show it off!  
                    By the way, we have eight apple trees that have the most beautiful blooms in the spring, thus our name!</div>
